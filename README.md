My name is **Ryan Kennedy** and I am a past student at Allegheny College who studied <ins>Integrative Informatics</ins> with an emphasis on <ins>Global Health Studies</ins>. <ins>Global Health Studies</ins> is also my minor. I have studied various aspects of global health-related data but primarily focused on the food industry and food insecurity. I have also focused my studies on general <ins>data analytics</ins> and <ins>database systems</ins> as well.

My senior comprehensive project, which I completed at Allegheny College, indulges in the current state of food insecurity within Crawford County, Pennsylvania. This project included creating an interactive <ins>Streamlit</ins> dashboard using <ins>Python</ins> that displays <ins>data visualizations</ins> such as tables and graphs. Specifically, these look at comparing Crawford County to every other county in PA, the previous 8 years of food insecurity in the county, and comparing every census tract within the county.
The dashboard also includes an embedded interactive map made in the geospatial software <ins>CARTO</ins>. This map displays an outline of Crawford County, PA, along with every census tract within the county. First, many types of food resources were plotted on the map. These include: charitable food resources such as food pantries, food banks, etc.; supermarkets, grocery stores, and convenience stores; and fast food establishments. The map also displays various types of food deserts, low-vehicle access regions, and low-income regions. Finally, a user can click on any of the plotted food resources or types of regions and view a variety of data.
Finally, the dashboard includes a tool that allows users to input their address, select a desired radius (in miles), and configure results of which food resources are closest to them within that radius.
This process included learning about various <ins>Python</ins> packages and libraries such as <ins>Pandas, Plotly, Geopy, Nominatium</ins>, and many others. This also required skills to compile data into <ins>CSV</ins> files through <ins>Google Sheets</ins>. <ins>Data Manipulation, Joining</ins>, and various <ins>Querying</ins> also occurred using <ins>SQL</ins> to maintain the data and apply it to specific parts of the dashboard. This specifically was important within <ins>CARTO</ins> to pull data from various sources and plot them on the map. Finally, this process included many rounds of <ins>literature research</ins> to understand food insecurity, and find sources to pull the data from.
I will continue to update and maintain this dashboard, as well as pursue a tactic to market it to policymakers and food insecure individuals of Crawford County.

I am a <ins>Web Designer</ins> for the Crawford County Food Alliance (CCFA), a collaborative network of non-profit organizations, students and faculty members of Allegheny College, and community members dedicated to enhancing access to local food resources in Crawford County, Pennsylvania. My role involves creating and maintaining the CCFA website on <ins>Google Sites</ins>, ensuring it is visually appealing, user-friendly, and effectively serves as a central hub for all food-related resources in the county.
I utilized <ins>Canva</ins> to design banners and other graphics to enhance the websiteâ€™s visual appeal. Additionally, I analyzed food insecurity data and integrated key resources, such as a Food Resource Guide (a comprehensive <ins>Google Doc</ins> detailing every charitable food resource in the county), a Food Map (an interactive <ins>Google Map</ins> plotting these resources), and a Food Calendar (a <ins>Google Calendar</ins> highlighting the availability of services throughout the week).
To promote the website among food-insecure individuals, I developed a marketing strategy that included designing flyers with QR codes, created with Canva, to direct users to the website. After launching the marketing campaign, I leveraged <ins>Google Analytics</ins> to perform <ins>Web Data Analyses</ins>, gaining insights into user interactions with the site. I also generated detailed <ins>Reports</ins> to better visualize and understand these interactions. Currently, I continue to update and manage the website, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for the community.

Some of my other projects have included:
- Using <ins>R</ins> to create different plots and run regressions, to overall compare different vegetable oils in high, medium, and low-income countries and how those oils could be related to obesity rates.
- Using <ins>SQL</ins> to discover links within one of Acutec's databases they currently use today when managing faulty parts, and parts to use to build their aerospace vehicles.

I will continue to update my repository with any projects I have previously completed, or any I am currently working on.
