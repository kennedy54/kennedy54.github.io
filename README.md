Welcome to my Personal Github page!

My name is **Ryan Kennedy** and I am a current student at Allegheny College studying <ins>Integrative Informatics</ins> with an emphasis on <ins>Global Health Studies</ins>. I have studied various aspects of global health-related data but primarily focused on the food industry and food insecurity. I have also focused my studies in general data analytics and database systems as well.
I am completing my senior composition project that indulges in the current state of food insecurity within Crawford County, Pennsylvania. This project includes creating an interactive <ins>Streamlit</ins> dashboard using <ins>Python</ins> that displays visualizations such as charts, graphs, various plots, and most importantly a map that conveys and compares food insecurity data in this region.
Some of my other projects have included:
- Using <ins>R</ins> to create different plots and run regressions, to overall compare different vegetable oils in high, medium, and low-income countries and how those oils could be related to obesity rates.
- Using <ins>SQLite3</ins> to discover links within one of Acutec's databases they currently use today when managing faulty parts, and parts to use to build their aerospace vehicles.

I will continue to update my repository with any projects I have previously completed, or any I am currently working on.
