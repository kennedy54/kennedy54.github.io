Welcome to my Personal Github page!

My name is **Ryan Kennedy** and I am a past student at Allegheny College who studied <ins>Integrative Informatics</ins> with an emphasis on <ins>Global Health Studies</ins>. <ins>Global Health Studies</ins> is also my minor. I have studied various aspects of global health-related data but primarily focused on the food industry and food insecurity. I have also focused my studies in general data analytics and database systems as well.
My senior comprehensive project indulges in the current state of food insecurity within Crawford County, Pennsylvania. This project included creating an interactive <ins>Streamlit</ins> dashboard using <ins>Python</ins> that displays visualizations such as charts, graphs, various plots, and most importantly a map that conveys and compares food insecurity data in this region.
Some of my other projects have included:
- Using <ins>R</ins> to create different plots and run regressions, to overall compare different vegetable oils in high, medium, and low-income countries and how those oils could be related to obesity rates.
- Using <ins>SQL</ins> to discover links within one of Acutec's databases they currently use today when managing faulty parts, and parts to use to build their aerospace vehicles.

I will continue to update my repository with any projects I have previously completed, or any I am currently working on.
